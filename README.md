# **Research framework**
## **Introduction**
Central nervous system tumors pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges because the histoprognostic criteria of the WHO classification are not always appropriate for them. In response to these challenges, medical decision-making follows a multidisciplinary approach through multidisciplinary consultation meetings. The implementation of the Multidisciplinary Consultation Meeting (MCM) primarily requires high-quality human resources, particularly specialist physicians, which affects certain regions of the world, including West Africa.

## **Research Methodology**

### **Type and framework of the study**

This study is part of a **quantitative descriptive and analytical** cross-sectional approach, carried out between [insert dates if available] among neuro-oncology professionals practicing in nine countries of the ECOWAS region (Benin, Niger, Ivory Coast, Mali, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo). The main objective was to assess professional practices, available human resources and multidisciplinary collaboration mechanisms in neuro-oncology in the sub-region.

### **Study Population**

The survey targeted a total of **35 healthcare professionals** involved in neuro-oncological care. The sample included:

* **Neurosurgeons** (45.71%),
* **Neuro-oncology residents** (51.43%),
*And other specialties such as **anatomopathologists** and **specialist nurses**.

Participants were selected based on their membership in specialized healthcare facilities, professional networks, or neuro-oncology training programs. The countries chosen were based on their membership in ECOWAS and their involvement in emerging neuro-oncology networks.

### **Data Collection Method**

Data were collected using a **self-administered structured questionnaire**, developed by the authors based on a literature review and discussions with experts. This questionnaire included modules relating to:

* To the sociodemographic and professional characteristics of the respondents;
* The frequency of the procedures and examinations carried out;
* The availability of specialized infrastructure;
* The existence and operation of multidisciplinary consultation frameworks.

The questionnaire was distributed electronically via professional channels (emails, scientific platforms, specialist networks).

### **Data Analysis**

The collected data were entered and analyzed using **STATA version 15** software. The analysis consisted of:

* **Descriptive statistics** (frequencies, percentages) for categorical variables;
* A **spectral analysis** of staffing levels and resources, enabling the highlighting of regional disparities, critical deficits by specialty, and the organization of multidisciplinary consultation systems.

Spectral analysis has been used to:

* Represent the distribution of specialized staff by discipline and by country;
* Identify the operational gradients of neuro-oncological centers;
* Assess the presence or absence of functional consultation frameworks;
* Examine the factors (structural and cyclical) associated with the absence of effective multidisciplinary collaboration.

## **Summary of Results**

### 1. **Profile of Respondents**

The study was conducted among **35 healthcare professionals** specializing in neuro-oncology across **nine ECOWAS countries**. The majority of respondents were **neurosurgeons (45.71%)** and **neuro-oncology residents (51.43%)**. The most represented nationalities were **Benin (25.71%)**, **Niger (17.14%)**, **Côte d’Ivoire (14.29%)**, **Mali (14.29%)**, and **Ghana (11.43%)**.

### 2. **Experience and Clinical Practices**

* **57.14%** of participants had **less than three years of experience** in neuro-oncology.
* **74.29%** reported **fewer than 100 patient consultations per year**.
* **88.57%** performed **tumor resection surgeries**, with the majority (90.32%) carrying out **fewer than 100 such surgeries annually**.
* **Awake craniotomy** was performed by only **34.29%** of respondents.
* **Stereotactic biopsies** were even less common, performed by only **28.57%** of specialists.

### 3. **Available Examinations and Treatments**

* The most commonly performed procedures included **chemotherapy (82.86%)**, **anatomopathological examinations (80.00%)**, and **clinical trial protocols (74.29%)**.
* Advanced techniques such as **immunohistochemistry (51.43%)** and **molecular biology testing (14.29%)** were far less frequent.

### 4. **Resources and Specialized Centers**

* **Nigeria** had the highest number of neuro-oncology centers (14), but only **9 were operational**, yielding an operational rate of **64.29%**.
* **Senegal**, **Ghana**, and **Côte d’Ivoire** each had **2 to 3 operational centers**.
* Despite its infrastructure, Nigeria had the **lowest neurosurgeon-to-population ratio**, with **1 neurosurgeon per 1.6 million inhabitants**, compared to **1 per 700,000 in Senegal**.

### 5. **Existence of Multidisciplinary Consultation Frameworks**

* Only **34.29%** of respondents reported the existence of a **multidisciplinary consultation framework** in their country.
* **Senegal**, **Ghana**, and **Côte d’Ivoire** were the only countries where **100% of specialists** had access to such frameworks.
* **Togo**, **Niger**, **Benin**, and **Burkina Faso** had **no functional multidisciplinary consultation structures**.

### 6. **Barriers to Multidisciplinary Collaboration**

The main obstacles identified include:

* **Shortage of specialists** across disciplines, especially in less-resourced Francophone countries.
* **Poor collaboration dynamics** among existing professionals (a contextual factor).
* **Lack of strategic vision and leadership** at the regional level (a structural factor).
* **Non-operational frameworks** in countries like **Nigeria** and **Mali**, where existing consultation structures are reported to be dysfunctional.

### 7. **Regional Prospects**

* **94.29%** of respondents supported the creation of a **West African regional collaboration network** in neuro-oncology.
* **97.14%** were in favor of establishing a **regional inter-university diploma** to enhance academic exchange and recognition of professional competencies.
