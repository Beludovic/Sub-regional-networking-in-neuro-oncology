# **Research framework**
## **Introduction**
Central nervous system tumors pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges because the histoprognostic criteria of the WHO classification are not always appropriate for them. In response to these challenges, medical decision-making follows a multidisciplinary approach through multidisciplinary consultation meetings. The implementation of the Multidisciplinary Consultation Meeting (MCM) primarily requires high-quality human resources, particularly specialist physicians, which affects certain regions of the world, including West Africa.

## **Research Methodology**

### **Type and framework of the study**

This study is part of a **quantitative descriptive and analytical** cross-sectional approach, carried out between [insert dates if available] among neuro-oncology professionals practicing in nine countries of the ECOWAS region (Benin, Niger, Ivory Coast, Mali, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo). The main objective was to assess professional practices, available human resources and multidisciplinary collaboration mechanisms in neuro-oncology in the sub-region.

### **Study Population**

The survey targeted a total of **35 healthcare professionals** involved in neuro-oncological care. The sample included:

* **Neurosurgeons** (45.71%),
* **Neuro-oncology residents** (51.43%),
*And other specialties such as **anatomopathologists** and **specialist nurses**.

Participants were selected based on their membership in specialized healthcare facilities, professional networks, or neuro-oncology training programs. The countries chosen were based on their membership in ECOWAS and their involvement in emerging neuro-oncology networks.

### **Data Collection Method**

Data were collected using a **self-administered structured questionnaire**, developed by the authors based on a literature review and discussions with experts. This questionnaire included modules relating to:

* To the sociodemographic and professional characteristics of the respondents;
* The frequency of the procedures and examinations carried out;
* The availability of specialized infrastructure;
* The existence and operation of multidisciplinary consultation frameworks.

The questionnaire was distributed electronically via professional channels (emails, scientific platforms, specialist networks).

### **Data Analysis**

The collected data were entered and analyzed using **STATA version 15** software. The analysis consisted of:

* **Descriptive statistics** (frequencies, percentages) for categorical variables;
* A **spectral analysis** of staffing levels and resources, enabling the highlighting of regional disparities, critical deficits by specialty, and the organization of multidisciplinary consultation systems.

Spectral analysis has been used to:

* Represent the distribution of specialized staff by discipline and by country;
* Identify the operational gradients of neuro-oncological centers;
* Assess the presence or absence of functional consultation frameworks;
* Examine the factors (structural and cyclical) associated with the absence of effective multidisciplinary collaboration.

## **Author and supervision**

The project is supervised by Dr. Wilfried Dossou, _Neurosurgeon, member of the Beninese Society of Neurosurgery_, in accordance with the rules of ethics and professional conduct in research.
